  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Chicken katsu is Japanese-style fried chicken. This is my family recipe and can also be used to make tonkatsu by using pork cutlets instead of chicken. Serve with white rice and tonkatsu sauce.</p>
  <p>Katsu is a Japanese dish of crispy fried cutlets coated with Panko bread crumbs. Popular varieties are chicken katsu (like this recipe) and tonkatsu (which is made with pork).</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - pounded to 1/2 inch thickness</li>
      <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
      <li>1 cup panko bread crumbs</li>
      <li>1 cup oil for frying, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Season chicken breasts on both sides with salt and pepper. Place flour, beaten egg, and panko crumbs into separate shallow dishes. Coat chicken breasts in flour, shaking off any excess; dip into egg, and then press into panko crumbs until well coated on both sides.</li>
      <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place chicken in the hot oil, and fry until golden brown, 3 or 4 minutes per side. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain..</li>
    </ol>
